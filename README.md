Compiler is used to compile any programming language

The name of the website is Online Compiler,the website allows user to execute programs. Whenever a person wants to compile any programming language ,we can use our centralized compiler. Generally we can go through many compilers which are available in online so it takes a lot of time,in this case we can use centralized compilers which means easier to compile in efficient manner.choice at any time conveniently from their mobile phoneor laptop etc..The reason behind the development of this website because a lot of people/students suffering from exams or online practicals.Because,they didnâ€™t have good source to practice languages in online.Due to our centralized system they compile
one language to another language.

MAIN OBJECTIVE
Online Compiler project main idea is to help students who want to learn any programming languages such as JAVA,C,C++,NODE JS without installing compiler in their own system. Students need to write any programming language code and paste it to online compiler and press run button system will send information to server when compiler is installed and it will test the code at server side and send result information to client within few seconds.
